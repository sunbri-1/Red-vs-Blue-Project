# Red-vs-Blue-Project

Red Team
Utilized penetration testing techniques to compromise a vulnerable server.  Website directory browsing allowed for discovery of sensitive information which led to a brute force attempt to log in as a particular user.  Tools such as hydra, dirb, and john the ripper were utilized to obtain directory information and user access.  Metasploit was utilized to uncover vulnerabilities and to establish a meterpreter session through a reverse shell vulnerability on the server.

Blue Team
Monitored network traffic using ELK stack and recommended threshold alerts based on normal levels of network traffic. Advised on vulnerability mitigation strategy and proper network security protocols to harden the server against future attacks.
